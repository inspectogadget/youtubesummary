Download youtube videos, converts the audio to txt, then sends txt to chatGPT to create a summary of the video's
key points in bullet form.

Requirements.txt is supplied.

I wanted to create a script that would prompt me for a youtube URL, downloads the audio from the URL, converts
to wav, then to txt. It then sends then sends the txt to ChatGPT and has it summarize the txt and saves it as 
output.txt. 


This is my first python program.
